# Conceptual steps:
# 1. Derive a key from the passphrase (e.g., using PBKDF2 or similar KDF)
#    This is typically done in programming languages, not directly in shell for a "hashed passphrase"
#    For a simple, fixed passphrase, OpenSSL can use it directly as a key
# 2. Encrypt the 'amount' value using this key

# Example: Encrypting a single amount (e.g., 123.45) from a file or variable
# This is a highly simplified example and NOT for production use directly.
# Replace 'your_secret_passphrase' with the actual passphrase
# The '-pbkdf2' is crucial for deriving a key from a passphrase.
# The actual amount data would need to be read from the FactSales table row by row.

# To encrypt a string '123.45' using a passphrase and store it as base64
# This is NOT a direct database command, but a conceptual encryption step
echo "123.45" | openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -e -base64 -pbkdf2 -k "your_secret_passphrase" > encrypted_amount.txt

# This output (encrypted_amount.txt) would then be inserted into the database.
# In a real scenario, you'd iterate through rows of FactSales, encrypt each amount,
# and then update the 'amount' field (which would need to be of a suitable type, e.g., VARBINARY or BLOB, to store encrypted data).

# SQL command to update the table with encrypted data (conceptual)
# This assumes 'amount' column type is suitable for binary/encrypted data
# And 'encrypted_data_blob' comes from the output of an encryption process like above
# This would be part of a larger update script, not a single command.
-- UPDATE FactSales SET amount = 'encrypted_data_blob' WHERE sales_id = 123;
