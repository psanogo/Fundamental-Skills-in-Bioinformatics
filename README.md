# Fundamental Skills in Bioinformatics

[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

A repository of materials for learning essential computational skills for bioinformatics analysis. This repository is designed for biologists, students, and researchers who are new to bioinformatics and want to build a solid foundation in the computational tools and techniques used in the field.

This README provides a guide to setting up your environment and navigating the content.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you will need to have the following software installed on your system. We highly recommend using `conda` to manage your software environments, as it is a standard tool in the bioinformatics community.

1.  **Conda:** If you don't have it, install Miniconda for your operating system.
2.  **Git:** You will need Git to clone the repository. Installation instructions can be found here.

## Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    Open your terminal and run the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Fundamental-Skills-in-Bioinformatics.git
    cd Fundamental-Skills-in-Bioinformatics
    ```
    > **Note**: Remember to replace `your-username` with the correct GitHub username or organization.

2.  **Create and activate the conda environment:**
    An `environment.yml` file is often included to ensure all users have the same package versions. If you have one, you can create the environment like this:

    ```bash
    # Create the environment from the yml file
    conda env create -f environment.yml

    # Activate the new environment
    conda activate bioinfo-skills
    ```
    If you don't have an `environment.yml` file, I can help you create one!

## Topics Covered

This repository is organized into several key areas. Each topic should have its own directory containing relevant notes, scripts, and data.

-   **01-Command-Line:** Learn to navigate the Unix/Linux command line.
-   **02-Python-for-Bioinformatics:** Introduction to Python for automating tasks and analyzing biological data.
-   **03-R-for-Data-Visualization:** Learn to use R and `ggplot2` for data visualization.
-   **04-Version-Control-with-Git:** Understand version control with Git and collaboration on GitHub.

## Usage

Navigate to the directory for the topic you are interested in and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file within that directory. This modular approach keeps information clean and easy to find.

## Contributing

Contributions are always welcome! If you find any errors or have suggestions for improvements, please open an issue or submit a pull request.

## License

It's a good practice to include a license. The MIT License is a popular choice for open-source projects. You should add a `LICENSE` file to the root of your repository.
